# SortingAlgorithmComparison
Compares 2 Sorting algorithms in 2 languages
Quicksort and Merge sort
It does this by comparing 2 lists of 15 elements, and 1 list of 1,000 random elements
Think of the 2 lists as control units, that have no randomness. The 1,000 elements are there
to show how the sorting algorithm can scale.
Languages used: Haskall and C++
Note: Despite the file being called (quicksort.hs), this has both sorting algorithms in it
